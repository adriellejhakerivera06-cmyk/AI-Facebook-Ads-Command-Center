# Build Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. TypeScript Error in Meta Sync Route
**File**: `src/app/api/meta/sync/route.ts`
**Line**: 132-143
**Problem**: Missing `|| null` fallback for `bmId` property when looking up specific ad account

**Fix**: Changed from:
```typescript
bmId: account.business_manager_id 
```

To:
```typescript
bmId: account.business_manager_id || null
```

**Reason**: The TypeScript type expects `bmId: string | null`, but `business_manager_id` from database could be `undefined`, causing type mismatch.

---

### 2. TypeScript Error in Ad Account Filter Provider
**File**: `src/providers/AdAccountFilterProvider.tsx`
**Line**: 136
**Problem**: Function name mismatch - trying to export `setSelectedAdAccount` but actual function is named `setSelectedAdAccountId`

**Fix**: Changed from:
```typescript
setSelectedAdAccount,
```

To:
```typescript
setSelectedAdAccount: setSelectedAdAccountId,
```

**Reason**: The interface defines `setSelectedAdAccount` but the internal state uses `setSelectedAdAccountId`. We aliased the export to match the interface.

---

### 3. Runtime Error: useAdAccountFilter Context Provider
**File**: `src/components/layout/DashboardLayout.tsx`
**Lines**: 306-316
**Problem**: `AdAccountFilter` component was being rendered even when not wrapped by `AdAccountFilterProvider`, causing "must be used within AdAccountFilterProvider" error

**Fix**: Added conditional rendering:
```typescript
{/* Ad Account Filter - Desktop */}
{currentWorkspace && (
  <div className="hidden lg:block flex-1">
    <AdAccountFilter />
  </div>
)}

{/* Ad Account Filter - Mobile */}
{currentWorkspace && (
  <div className="lg:hidden mt-4">
    <AdAccountFilter />
  </div>
)}
```

**Reason**: The `AdAccountFilterProvider` only wraps `DashboardLayout` when `currentWorkspace` exists (see `src/app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx`). But `DashboardLayout` was always trying to render `AdAccountFilter`, which uses the `useAdAccountFilter` hook. This caused a context error when the provider wasn't present.

✅ **Static generation**: PASSED (61 pages)  
✅ **Runtime context error**: FIXED

## Deployment History

### Commit 1: dd256ca
- Fixed TypeScript errors in sync route and filter provider
- Status: ❌ Failed (Runtime error in production)

### Commit 2: 326d957 (CURRENT)
- Fixed context provider runtime error
- Status: ⏳ Deploying to Vercel

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Commit and push fixes
2. ⏳ Wait for Vercel deployment to complete
3. 🔄 Test in production:
   - Verify app loads without errors
   - Run "Sync All" to populate business managers
   - Verify filter dropdowns appear in dashboard
   - Test 2-level filtering (Business Portfolio → Ad Account)
   - Verify all dashboard pages respect the filter

---

## Feature Status: Global Ad Account Filter

### ✅ Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETE)
- Created filter provider context
- Created API routes for business managers and ad accounts
- Built UI component with cascading dropdowns
- Added localStorage persistence

### ✅ Phase 2: Integration (COMPLETE)
- Wrapped dashboard layout with provider
- Added filter to dashboard top bar
- Updated campaigns page to use filter
- Campaigns now filter by selected ad account

### ✅ Phase 3: Business Manager Sync (COMPLETE)
- Added BM sync to Meta sync route
- Links ad accounts to business managers
- TypeScript errors fixed
- Context provider error fixed
- Ready for production testing

### 🔄 Next: Testing & Validation
Once deployed, need to:
1. Run sync to populate business managers
2. Test filter dropdowns work
3. Verify filtering across all pages
4. Check graceful degradation if no BMs

## Technical Details

### Context Provider Pattern
```
Layout Hierarchy:
- ProtectedLayout (auth check)
  └─ WorkspaceProvider
     └─ DashboardContent
        └─ if (currentWorkspace):
           └─ AdAccountFilterProvider
              └─ DashboardLayout
                 └─ if (currentWorkspace):
                    └─ AdAccountFilter (uses hook)
```

The fix ensures `AdAccountFilter` only renders when inside the provider context.

## Notes

- Redis connection warnings during build are expected (Redis is optional for caching)
- Build completes successfully in ~13-14 seconds
- All 61 pages generated without errors
- Filter will only show when user has selected a workspace
